## Introduction:

The paper discusses the importance of hand-crafted features with respect to privacy enabled machine learning, specifically differential privacy. 

## Contributions:

The paper proves the importance of hand-crafted features, they are able to support their claims with results, where they are able to:

* On CIFAR-10 they exceed the accuracy reported by Papernot et al. (2020b) while simultaneously improving the provable DP-guarantee by 130 times.
* On MNIST, they match the privacy-utility guarantees obtained with PATE (Papernot et al., 2018) without requiring access to any public data.
*
