# Federated-Learning
Privacy preserving learning for Federated Learning.

Exploring Federated Learning and developing a better understanding of such technologies become important as digital data continues to grow. Although powerful, Machine Learning/Deep Learning consume too much data, which may enable threats for data leakage. Consumer alignments, choices, details, etc. can come under threat and therefore Federated Learning is something I wish to explore.
